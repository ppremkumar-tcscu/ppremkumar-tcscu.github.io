        <p>This web page is about basketball</p>
    </div>
    <p>My favorite sport is basketball. I have been playing basketball for a long time, about 5 years.</p>
    <p>My favorite team is the Cleveland Cavaliers. I like them, because of two reasons. First I like the players like Lebron James and Kyre Irving. Also I just like the way they play, because they move the ball around.</p>

    <p>My favorite player is: I do not have one. Everyone has his or her special ability that they should use. This is a good dream team: Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Micheal Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Shaquille O'Neal.</p>

    <p>The part I am best at is rebounding and passing.</p>
