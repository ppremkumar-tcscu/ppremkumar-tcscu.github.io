    <p>I love to read. Reading has always captivated me. If you read you get transported to different worlds.</p>
    <p>I like to got to the library. There are a lot of cool books there. Plus there are videogames.</p>
    <p>I like to read fiction a bit more than nonfiction. In fiction I like sci-fi, </p>
